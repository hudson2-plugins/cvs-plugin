  The CVS connection string Hudson uses to connect to the server. The format is
  the same as <tt>$CVSROOT</tt> environment variable (<tt>:protocol:user:password@host:path</tt>)
  Password is optional, if it wasn't specified Hudson uses credential from .cvspass (by default from user home,
    this location can be changed on the global configuration page).
